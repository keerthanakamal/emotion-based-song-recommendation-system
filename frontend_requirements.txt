Frontend Requirements for Emotion-Based Song Recommendation System
System Overview
You're building a web frontend for a mood-intensifying music recommender that:

Takes text input describing a user's emotional state
Analyzes the text to detect emotions
Recommends songs that would intensify that emotion (specifically Hindi and Malayalam songs only)
Displays recommendations with song titles and artists
API Endpoints
Main Recommendation Endpoint
URL: /recommend (POST)
Request Body

  "user_text": "Text describing user's mood",
  "languages": ["hindi", "malayalam"]

  "emotion": "sad/angry/fearful/happy/neutral",
  "recommendations": [
    {"title": "Song Title 1", "artist": "Artist Name 1", "language": "hindi"},
    {"title": "Song Title 2", "artist": "Artist Name 2", "language": "malayalam"},
    ...
  ]
}
